# Contact Service
**Author:** Nathan Brophy 
This is a lightweight and fully customizeable from the [configuration file](https://github.com/nathanbrophy/contact_service/blob/master/routes/serverConfig.json) server side application that processes and validates form data to send emails via the postmark app API.  It is meant to be hit from a post method in your application to a custom url i.e. mysite.com/contactservice, and then proxy this request url to hit our application.
